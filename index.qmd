Hello, I'm Nithin.
Welcome to my website! I’m an economist specializing in macroeconomics, with a passion for data analysis and programming. 

Currently, I am  Research Assistant at State Planning Board, Government of Kerala

Beyond research and coding, I’m also an endurance athlete, always pushing boundaries—whether in economic modeling or on the track.
